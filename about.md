This blog is simply a labor of love for me. Although not specifically part of my work, much of the content here relates to my job as an IT Director at a place called the [Minnesota Population Center](http://www.pop.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota. I think it's a really neat, unique, special snowflake kind of place, and you should [check out our tech blog](http://tech.popdata.org/).

Outside of work, I have a wide range of interests, including family life as a husband and father, biking, cooking, reading (mostly sci fi), home automation / digital life, DIY projects, and sports, especially hockey and football.  I hope all of it finds a place on this blog someday.
