title: Running Ubuntu 16.04 on the Dell XPS 9370 13" Laptop
layout: post
---

I recently started using a Dell XPS 13" Developer Edition (9370) running Ubuntu 16.04 as my work laptop. As I go through setup I thought it would be a good idea to keep track of all the little tweaks I'm doing. I hope someone finds this useful.

My Dell XPS 13" Developer Edition was manufactured in June 2018. Depending on manufacture date, some of the problems below may not exist, or have different solutions.

My laptop has 16GB of memory, a 512GB SSD, and the QHD+ touchscreen. I dock at work with the TB16 dock to my old 27" Apple Thunderbolt Display.

I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 and Unity. I will eventually upgrade to 18.04 and Gnome when Dell officially supports it. I really need my work laptop to work, so I'm in no hurry to upgrade.

# Hardware Issues

Here are notes on how I handled various hardware issues.

## Out of the box

The laptop mostly worked out of the box, which was a pleasant surprise.

The fan rattles badly at low RPM. I suspect this will eventually require warranty replacement. The fan is not usually on, unless I'm doing a ton of disk I/O (e.g. installing a lot of packages). Once it gets to higher RPM it sounds fine.

The 1 key is not backlit. Actually it's just the 1 that's dark; the ! is backlit. This doesn't really bother me but I assume it's supposed to be lit.

## BIOS

I haven't had to change any BIOS settings. It seems like earlier owners did for some issues (e.g. getting a TB16 dock to work).

You may optionally want to disable Content Adaptive Brightness Control (adjusts screen brightness based on screen content) if it bothers you. You can test if it is enabled on this page: https://tylerwatt12.com/dc/ I don't find it bothersome.

As of June 2018, the BIOS has default settings to "trust" the Dell Thunderbolt docks, which solved a lot of docking problems.

## Super (Windows) Key

This one was surprisingly complicated. It ships disabled by default. I read somewhere this is because of some licensing thing between Dell and Microsoft.

You really want that key to bring up Dash search. To do so:

## Fn Keys

Fn-Esc toggles the default Fn key behavior between the media controls and the function keys themselves. What I mean is, if you want to just be able to hit F2 and have it lower sound, for instance, you may need to hit Fn-Esc to toggle that behavior on.

## Sleep/Resume

There were a lot of issues reported by earlier users that the laptop would not go into deep sleep, and therefore would drain battery quickly when suspended. I have not experienced that and a look at `cat /sys/power/mem_sleep` shows `s2idle [deep]`, which is what you want (deep to be selected).

## Touchpad

I find my big, clumsy hands are constantly hitting the trackpad and messing up my typing. There are a couple of different solutions out there for this problem, but I tried [touchpad-indicator](https://github.com/atareao/Touchpad-Indicator), and it's done a really nice job for me. It will disable the touchpad when it detects typing. It will also disable the touchpad when it detects an external mouse (including my bluetooth mouse). This is all configurable.

## Bluetooth

Many users report bluetooth issues particularly after resume from suspend, and I definitely experienced it too. Bluetooth would appear active after suspend, and it would even report my mouse as connected, but it would not work.

I found [this long thread](https://www.dell.com/community/Linux-Developer-Systems/XPS-13-9370-no-bluetooth-after-suspend/td-p/6022892) on the Dell forums. Here was [the key post](https://www.dell.com/community/Linux-Developer-Systems/XPS-13-9370-no-bluetooth-after-suspend/m-p/6084824/highlight/true#M8497) for me. That user made a [small script](https://github.com/sankethkatta/dell-xps-ubuntu-bluetooth) which attempts to restart bluetooth after suspend using the `rfkill` command. It works for me about 75% of the time automatically as it is designed to do. The other 25% of the time, it doesn't seem to wake back up after suspend (I can see the bluetooth icon in the taskbar is still disabled). In those cases, I just need to run the `sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth` command manually and it works again.

## Webcam

The webcam was not working out of the box. Users have reported this is because newer XPS 13"s like mine have a webcam firmware version 1.5 instead of the older 1.0, which worked out of the box. The fix for this is:

## Docking with the TB16

_Note: As of June 2018, the BIOS had default settings to "trust" the Dell Thunderbolt docks, which seems to have solved a lot of docking problems earlier users had. If you have an earlier version, you might need to set your Thunderbolt security to None in the BIOS._

My Thunderbolt monitor, wired keyboard, wired mouse, and USB3/Thunderbolt charging all just worked out of the box with the laptop.

The headphone jack on the TB16 is not currently working. When I plug headphones in there, it doesn't show up as one of the sound output devices in Ubuntu, and sound still comes from the laptop speakers. This isn't a huge deal as the laptop itself has a headphone jack that's actually closer and more convenient to me, but I'm going to keep working on this.

### Special Note on Apple Cinema and Thunderbolt Displays

I read that the Apple Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt adapter will not work with Dell's TB16 dock. Luckily, I read this before purchase, so I ordered a [Startech Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt adapter](https://www.startech.com/Cables/thunderbolt-3-cables/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-thunderbolt-adapter~TBT3TBTADAP) (which is also a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2) adapter. This worked perfectly. This was the [relevant thread on the Dell forums](https://www.dell.com/community/Laptops-General/Connecting-a-Thunderbolt-Cinema-Display-to-TB16-Dock-Dell-XPS-15/td-p/5104603).

# Software / Application Issues

## Ubuntu

I updated Ubuntu packages immediately via `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`. There were _many_ upgrades available, right out of the box, including a newer kernel.

Interestingly, the Ubuntu Software GUI app seems to crash a few seconds after launch. Not sure what this is about but probably won't debug it as I prefer doing updates from the command line anyhow.

Atom needed the atom-touch-events package to be installed to enable touch scrolling and zooming.
